\title{Synthetic Household Survey Data}
\format{
A data frame with 20,034 rows (individuals), 10,099 households and 15 variables:
\describe{
\item{person_id}{Character. Unique person identifier (format: P00000001, P00000002, ...)}
\item{hh_id}{Character. Household identifier. All individuals in the same
household share this ID (format: HH000001, HH000002, ...)}
\item{NUTS1}{Character. NUTS1 region code (5 macro-regions):
\itemize{
\item N
\item S
\item NE
\item NO
\item C}}
\item{NUTS2}{Character. NUTS2 region code (30 regions, format: N01-N06, S01-S06, ...)}
\item{NUTS3}{Character. NUTS3 province code (120 provinces, format: N01001-N01004, ...)}
\item{municipality}{Character. Municipality code (1,079 municipalities,
format: N010010001-N010010008, ...)}
\item{age}{Integer. Age in years (0-80)}
\item{age_class}{Factor. Age class with 7 levels:
"0-14", "15-17", "18-24", "25-34", "35-49", "50-64", "65+"}
\item{gender}{Integer. Gender code:
\itemize{
\item 1 = Male
\item 2 = Female
}}
\item{education_level}{Character. Education level (adults 18+ only, NA for minors):
\itemize{
\item "Low" = No education, primary, or lower secondary (ISCED 0-2)
\item "Medium" = Upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary (ISCED 3-5)
\item "High" = Tertiary education (ISCED 6-8)
}}
\item{employment_status}{Character. Main activity status:
\itemize{
\item "Employed" = In employment
\item "Unemployed" = Unemployed
\item "Retired" = Retired
\item "Student" = Student or pupil
\item "Other" = Other (unable to work, domestic tasks, etc.)
}}
\item{hh_size}{Integer. Household size (number of members): 1-7}
\item{hh_type}{Character. Household type:
\itemize{
\item "Single" = One-person household
\item "Couple" = Two adults without children
\item "Single_parent" = Single parent with children
\item "Family" = Household with children (2+ adults)
\item "Other" = Other household types
}}
\item{eq_income}{Numeric. Equivalised disposable household income in euros.
This is the total household income divided by the OECD modified equivalence
scale. All household members share the same equivalised income.}
\item{hh_income}{Numeric. Total disposable household income in euros before
equivalisation. All household members share the same total income.}
\item{oecd_scale}{Numeric. OECD modified equivalence scale for the household:
\itemize{
\item First adult (14+): weight = 1.0
\item Other adults (14+): weight = 0.5 each
\item Children (< 14): weight = 0.3 each
}
Formula: modif_oecd_scale = 1.0 + 0.5 × (n_adults - 1) + 0.3 × n_children}
\item{weight}{Numeric. Sampling weight (inverse inclusion probability).
Represents the number of individuals in the population represented by
this sample unit. All household members share the same weight.}

\description{
A realistic synthetic dataset based on the empirical structure of real IT-SILC
(Italian Survey on Income and Living Conditions) 2024 data. The \code{synthouse} dataset contains
20,034 individuals nested in 10,099 households, with detailed
demographic, socio-economic, and geographic information.
}
\details{
The synthetic dataset was generated to reproduce key characteristics of
IT-SILC data. It is primarily intended to demonstrate the computation of
quantile-based inequality indicators provided by the \code{inequantiles} package,
such as quantiles, influence functions, and the quantile ratio index (QRI).
The data structure mirrors that of IT-SILC but contains fictional values, therefore it
is suitable for methodology illustration and testing, not for policy analysis.

Geographic variables follow a hierarchical NUTS structure with
realistic proportions across macro-regions and were created randomly, they
do not correspond to real codes. Individual characteristics (age, gender, education, ..)
were assigned randomly based on conditional empirical distributions from IT-SILC.
Income was generated using a regression model fitted to IT-SILC data:
\deqn{log(eq_income) ~ education_head + n_employed + age_head +
          I(age_head^2) + hh_size}.
Sampling weights follow a lognormal distribution fitted to IT-SILC.

\strong{Key Statistics:}
\itemize{
\item Sample size: 20,034 individuals in 10,099 households
\item Average household size: ~1.99 (matching IT-SILC)
\item Estimated population: 15,749,925 individuals (the sum of the weights)
\item Geographic coverage: 5 macro-regions, 30 NUTS2, 120 NUTS3, 1,079 municipalities
