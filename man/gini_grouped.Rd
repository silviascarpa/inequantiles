\title{Gini Coefficient for Grouped Data}
\usage{
gini_grouped(Y, freq)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric vector of total amounts per group.
Each element represents the sum of the variable of interest (e.g. income, wealth,
consumption) for all individuals or units in that group.}

\item{freq}{Numeric vector of frequencies (number of individuals or units) per group.
Must have the same length as \code{Y}.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the estimated Gini coefficient on grouped data.
The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (complete inequality).
Note that it assumes equality within groups.
}
\description{
Computes the Gini coefficient from grouped income data based on linear
interpolation of income shares.
}
\details{
Consider grouped data divided into \eqn{L} classes with known boundaries,
observed frequencies \eqn{f_1, \ldots, f_L} and total amounts \eqn{Y_1, \ldots, Y_J}.
The Gini coefficient is approximated by linear interpolation of cumulative shares, as:

\deqn{G(s_j, u_j) \approx 1 - \sum_{j=1}^{J} (s_j + s_{j-1})(u_j - u_{j-1})}

where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{p_j = f_j / \sum_{i=1}^{J} f_i} is the population share of group \eqn{j};
\item \eqn{c_j = Y_j / \sum_{i=1}^{J} Y_i} is the share of the variable of interest in group \eqn{j};
\item \eqn{s_j = \sum_{k=1}^{j} c_k} is the cumulative share of the variable up to group \eqn{j};
\item \eqn{u_j = \sum_{k=1}^{j} p_k} is the cumulative population share up to group \eqn{j};
\item \eqn{s_0 = u_0 = 0} by convention.
}

This formula computes twice the area between the egalitarian line (perfect equality)
and the Lorenz curve obtained by linearly interpolating the points \eqn{(u_j, s_j)}.
Since it assumes all observations within a group have identical values, it provides
a \emph{lower-bound} estimate of the true Gini coefficient -- actual inequality may be larger
\insertCite{jorda2021inequality}{inequantiles}.
}
\note{
\strong{Important limitations:}
\itemize{
\item This is a \strong{lower bound} approximation. The true Gini coefficient
may be higher due to within-group inequality.
\item The bias magnitude depends on the number of groups and how they are defined.
\item Groups should ideally be defined to maximize within-group homogeneity.
