\usage{
quantile_grouped(
  freq,
  lower_bounds,
  upper_bounds,
  probs = 0.5,
  midpoints = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{freq}{Numeric vector of class frequencies (counts). Must be non-negative.}

\item{lower_bounds}{Numeric vector of lower class bounds. Must be strictly
increasing.}

\item{upper_bounds}{Numeric vector of upper class bounds. Must be strictly
increasing and greater than corresponding \code{lower_bounds}.}

\item{probs}{Numeric vector of probabilities (between 0 and 1) for which to
compute the quantiles. Default is 0.5 (median).}

\item{midpoints}{Optional numeric vector of class midpoints. Used only as
fallback when a quantile class has zero frequency. If \code{NULL}, the
midpoint is computed as the arithmetic mean of class bounds.}
}
\value{
A vector of estimated quantiles on grouped data corresponding to \code{probs}.
Returns \code{NA} if total frequency is zero or missing.
}
\description{
Computes quantiles from grouped frequency data using linear interpolation
within the quantile class.
}
\details{
Consider grouped data divided into \eqn{L} classes with known boundaries. Let:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{L_j} be the lower bound of the \eqn{j}-th quantile class
\item \eqn{U_j} be the upper bound of the \eqn{j}-th quantile class
\item \eqn{h_j = U_j - L_j} be the \eqn{j}-th quantile class width
\item \eqn{C_{j-1}} be the cumulative frequency up to the previous class
\item \eqn{f_j} be the frequency within the quantile class \eqn{j}
\item \eqn{N = \sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i} be the total frequency
}

The quantile class for the \eqn{p}-th quantile is the first class \eqn{j} such that:

\deqn{j = min\{i: C_i \geq pN \}}.

The \eqn{p}-th quantile \eqn{Q(p)} is then estimated by linear interpolation within the
quantile class:

\deqn{\widetilde{Q(p)} = L_j + \frac{(pN - C_{j-1})}{f_j} \cdot h_j}

The method assumes a uniform distribution of observations within
each class interval. This is a standard approach for grouped data when individual
observations are not available.

\section{Handling Open-Ended Classes}{


When dealing with administrative or tax data, the first class often is often defined
as negative income  (or incomes below zero) and the last class as incomes above
a certain threshold. In such cases, we have \code{-Inf} as the lower bound of the
first class and \code{Inf} as the upper bound of the last class.

If \code{Inf} values are present in the given bounds, the function imputes reasonable
bounds using the specified method:

\strong{For open left class (first lower bound = -Inf):}
The imputed first lower bound is given by:
\deqn{L_1^* = U_1 - h_2}

where \eqn{U_1} is the upper bound of the first class and \eqn{h_2 = U_2 - L_2}
is the width of the second class. This assumes the first class has the same
width as the second class.

\strong{For open right class (last upper bound = Inf):}

The imputed upper bound is given by:
\deqn{U_J^* = L_J + h_{J-1}}

where \eqn{L_J} is the lower bound of the last class and
\eqn{h_{J-1} = U_{J-1} - L_{J-1}} is the width of the second-to-last class.
This assumes the last class has the same width as the penultimate class.
}

\section{Special Cases}{

\itemize{
\item If the quantile class has zero frequency, the function returns the
class midpoint as a fallback.
\item If total frequency is zero or \code{NA}, the function returns \code{NA}
for all requested quantiles.

\examples{
# Basic usage: compute quartiles
freq <- c(5, 8, 10, 4, 3)
lower <- c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40)
upper <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

quantile_grouped(freq, lower, upper, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))

# Compute deciles
quantile_grouped(freq, lower, upper, probs = seq(0.1, 0.9, by = 0.1))

# With custom midpoints
midpts <- c(5, 15, 25, 35, 45)
quantile_grouped(freq, lower, upper, probs = 0.5, midpoints = midpts)

# Income distribution example
income_freq <- c(120, 180, 150, 80, 40, 20, 10)
income_lower <- c(0, 15000, 30000, 45000, 60000, 80000, 100000)
income_upper <- c(15000, 30000, 45000, 60000, 80000, 100000, 150000)

# Compute median income
quantile_grouped(income_freq, income_lower, income_upper, probs = 0.5)

# Compute income quintiles
quantile_grouped(income_freq, income_lower, income_upper,
                   probs = seq(0.2, 0.8, by = 0.2))
